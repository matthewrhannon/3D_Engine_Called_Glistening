# 3D_Engine_Called_Glistening
Glistening 3D Engine Glistening is one of the first 3D graphics engines I wrote. The final build has been lost, but this build includes much of the engine's features.

# Summary

This was the first graphics engine I wrote. The name glistening came from a thinking session
while lying in the tub. I placed my hand into the water, and the feeling from the water and hand
touching sparked the word ‘Glistening’ into my head. I thought it would be a good name for my new
project, so I went with it.

This code and binary distributions are of different versions of the engine. I was unable to find
the latest build that included the code for the terrain, but most of the rest of the engine is complete in
the code provided. Some of the features are text, skybox, entities, and more.
